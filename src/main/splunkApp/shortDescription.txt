The AppDynamics app allows you to mine application performance monitoring data from AppDynamics using its REST API. You can then slice and dice the data within Splunk using Search Processing Language (SPL). It also contains a notification client that can be extracted to an AppDynamics controller that will relay event and policy violation notifications in AppDynamics to Splunk and has the ability to cross-launch into AppDynamics from Splunk.
